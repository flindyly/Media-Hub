# Media Hub
Media Hub is a 7-week internship project I undertook at the University of Adelaide that involved developing a searchable and navigable repository of reusable media assets that are created and sourced by the [Media Production team](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/learning-enhancement-innovation/our-services/media-production) within [Learning Enhancement and Innovation (LEI)](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/learning-enhancement-innovation/). The tool is aimed to be used by professional and academic staff at the University of Adelaide to find material to use and re-use within their own courses. 

The Media Hub contains two main features:
1. An interface to search and filter through the Media Hub collection
2. An upload tool for adding metadata to the database and uploading the asset to Box

To be a supported and maintained product, the prototype utilises technology and frameworks already supported by the Media Production team:
* coded using Vue3 (Composition API and Single File Components), TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
* data stored on the Media Production teamâ€™s Google Firebase instance (Cloud Firestore)
* utilised Github and the mediaproduction.adelaide.edu.au domain for delivery of the tool
* used the UoA Box license to store large media assets
* utilised existing styles and aligned to the Media Production team standards

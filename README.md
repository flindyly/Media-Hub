# Media Hub
Media Hub is a 7-week internship project I undertook at the University of Adelaide that involved developing a searchable and navigable repository of reusable media assets that are created and sourced by the Media Production team within Learning Enhancement and Innovation (LEI). The tool is aimed to be used by professional and academic staff at the University of Adelaide to find material to use and re-use within their own courses. 

Developed using Vue3 (Composition API and Single File Components), TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. The database is maintained in Google's Cloud Firestore and media thumbnails are stored in Cloud Storage.
